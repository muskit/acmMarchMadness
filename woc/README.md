# Week of Code
My work for the Week of Code challenges of March Madness. Instruction READMEs are included in each challenge folder, alongside my work.

Using the READMEs, feel free to practice these challenges on your own in whatever language you want. All of my code, which includes a mix of Python and C#, passed the actual competition testing. So if you use the given `input.txt` in your practice, you can check your answers by simply running my code.

**Contents of each `input.txt` in these challenges are unique to my particular "group".**
