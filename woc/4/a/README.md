# Day 4 - The MIYAGI - Part A

A new breakthrough technology just got unveiled, the MIYAGI+

It’s a computer that is far more advanced than any computer we’ve seen before.

Its memory has two changes:
1. It can store ternary numbers (base 3) instead of the typical binary numbers (base 2)
2. Memory is stored in 2D instead of the typical 1D

The MIYAGI+ can have instructions that are made up of 2D areas.

The designers of the MIYAGI+ also made a sylistic choice to use `.`, `!`, and `#` instead of the normal `0` and `1`.

You’ve been tasked with analyzing a program written for the MIYAGI+ and find out how many times a given instruction occurs.

## Input

The first line contains two integers, `iw` and `ih`, which is the width and height of the instruction you need to count.

The following `ih` lines contain the instruction

The next two integers `pw` and `ph`, are the width and height of the memory for the program.

The following `ph` lines contain the program.

## Output

The number of times that the instruction occurs in the program
