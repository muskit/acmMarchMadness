# Day 2 - Patterns in Ï€ - Part A

Happy Pi Day! Your physics professor, Professor Pippy wanted to do a fun
pi-related problem. 

Here's the challenge: 

Write a program that takes in two inputs.

The first input is a string that represents the decimal expansion of Pi. 
The second input is a three-digit integer `d`

1. Count the number of times the three-digit integer `d` occurs in
the Pi string `c`

2. Then count the number of times that `c` occurs in
the Pi string. 

Unfortunately, professor Pippy had to leave for a dentist appointment
scheduled at 3:14pm!

Help professor Pippy solve this problem and you might just get an A in the class!


## Input
A string S representing the decimal expansion of Pi
A three-digit integer N (for example, 123, 456, or 789)

## Output

The number of times that `c` appears in the given pi string.

## Constraints
`100 <= d <= 999`
`777 <= pi string length <= 3141`

## Examples
