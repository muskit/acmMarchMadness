# Day 2 - Ï€ and pie  - Part C

Professor Pippy is going to his dentist appointment. He's very concerned that
he might get ripped off by the dentist, so he always consults three differnet
offices.

Professor Pippy is obsessed with optimization and wants to make sure that he finds the three dentist
offices that are closet to eachother.

In order to find out which dentist offices are the closest, he found all
groupings of 3 offices and drew a circle that perfect encompassed all of them.

The smaller the radius of the circle, the closer the dentist offices are.

This is really hard to do by hand, so Professor Pippy has asked if you could
help him locate the 3 dentist offices that are closest together (smallest radius)

## Input

The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of dentist offices

The next `n` following lines contain an integer `x` and a decimal `y`.

## Output

Output the circumference of the smallest circle containing 3 dentist offices.

## Constraints
`n = 20`
`-2000 <= x <= 2000`
`-2000 <= y <= 2000`

## Examples
